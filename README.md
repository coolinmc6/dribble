This is a Pinterest-clone following the tutorial by [Mackenzie Child](https://mackenziechild.me/) in his
[12-apps-in-12-weeks](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/) series.  
* The video for the tutorial is located here: [Week 12: How To Build A Dribble Type App With Rails 4](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/12/)
* Mackenzie's GitHub repo for this project is here: [muse](https://github.com/mackenziechild/muse)



* As a reminder, when generating a model, I don't have to specify the type if it is a string:
```shell
rails g model Post title link description:text
rails db:migrate
```
* maybe try adding each action and view at a time
